//! A pallet that's designed to ONLY do:
//!
//! If a nominator is not exposed at all in any `ErasStakers` (i.e. "has not backed any validators
//! in the last `BondingDuration` days"), then they can register themselves in this pallet, and move
//! quickly into a nomination pool.
//!
//! This pallet works of the basis of `on_idle`, meaning that it provides no guarantee about when it
//! will succeed, if at all. Moreover, the queue implementation is unordered. In case of congestion,
//! not FIFO ordering is provided.
//!
//! Stakers who are certain about NOT being exposed can register themselves with
//! [`Call::register_fast_unstake`]. This will chill, and fully unbond the staker, and place them in
//! the queue to be checked.
//!
//! Once queued, but not being actively processed, stakers can withdraw their request via
//! [`Call::deregister`].
//!
//! Once queued, a staker wishing to unbond can perform to further action in pallet-staking. This is
//! to prevent them from accidentally exposing themselves behind a validator etc.
//!
//! Once processed, if successful, no additional fees for the checking process is taken, and the
//! staker is instantly unbonded. Optionally, if the have asked to join a pool, their *entire* stake
//! is joined into their pool of choice.
//!
//! If unsuccessful, meaning that the staker was exposed sometime in the last `BondingDuration` eras
//! they will end up being slashed for the amount of wasted work they have inflicted on the chian.
